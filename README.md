# Restaurants

## About
This is a practice on how to use GraphQL and how to manipulate data with it. It takes an array of restaurants that I need to manipulate to complete certain tasks.

## How to Run
Download the files. Go to the Restaurant directory and run node index.js. Navigate to http://localhost:4000/graphql to manipulate the data!
